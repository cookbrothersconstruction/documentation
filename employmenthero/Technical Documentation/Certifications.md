# Certifications in Employment Hero

## The requirement

Health and Safety need to move away from BWARE, and accommodating "licenses and certifications" was a nice-to-have requirement of an HRIS system.

The block of work to focus on this was missed, and the commitment of H&S wasn't attained to a level where a full migration of this data could be properly assessed.

This is complicated by a number of factors:
- Recording keeping in BWARE has been poorly maintained
- BWARE is a horrible system with awful reporting
- Document records are stored as documents against a worker in BWARE as opposed to being directly associated with the training / license / certification / competency
- There is a long list of training / licenses / certifications / competencies and manually mapping these to Employment Hero's certifications module would be a non-trivial block of work
- Actually populating this data once mapped would be a large amount of work
- Mapping these certifications to the teams or individuals would need to be well defined, as would the process for maintaining them
- The requirement is that these records can be pulled and reported on for a new construction project, this reporting requirement would need to be formalized
- The approval step for certificions would need to be assigned regionally, meaning a lot 4 or 5 times the number of certifications globally which may become unwieldy


## What we're launching with

Until the viability can be properly assessed and this project planned, we have settled on only two certifications for launch:

### Driver License

As per the description of the certification, this would be:
"A photocopy or clear photograph of both sides of your driver license. This should be either a New Zealand Driver License or a driver license recognized in New Zealand."

This is of the **License** type, is optional, requires supporting documentation (copy of the license), contains questions regarding previous driving offences, and requires approval.

As H&S had indicated that approval should be done by the regional office admins, this certification is split into 4, one for each geopgraphical work region (Auckland, Canterbury, Southern Lakes, Otago). Each of the four is assigned to that regional **team** with the office admin as the approver:

### Workplace First Aid Course


## The experience as an existing employee at launch


## The experience as a newly onboarded employee post-launch


## Reminding employees to complete their own certifications

Employment Hero has a built-in report under **Compliance -> Certifications**:

Where you can report on (for example) outstanding, non-archived, optional certifications, and send a reminder to each individually:

## Populating this data on the employee's behalf

Administrators can modify the records against employees for certifications which are applied to them.
