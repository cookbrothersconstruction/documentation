# Certifications in Employment Hero

## The requirement

Health and Safety need to move away from BWARE, and accommodating "licenses and certifications" was a nice-to-have requirement of an HRIS system.

The block of work to focus on this was missed, and the commitment of H&S wasn't attained to a level where a full migration of this data could be properly assessed.

This is complicated by a number of factors:
- Recording keeping in BWARE has been poorly maintained
- BWARE is a horrible system with awful reporting
- Document records are stored as documents against a worker in BWARE as opposed to being directly associated with the training / license / certification / competency
- There is a long list of training / licenses / certifications / competencies and manually mapping these to Employment Hero's certifications module would be a non-trivial block of work
- Actually populating this data once mapped would be a large amount of work
- Mapping these certifications to the teams or individuals would need to be well defined, as would the process for maintaining them
- The requirement is that these records can be pulled and reported on for a new construction project, this reporting requirement would need to be formalized
- The approval step for certificions would need to be assigned regionally, meaning a lot 4 or 5 times the number of certifications globally which may become unwieldy


## What we're launching with

Until the viability can be properly assessed and this project planned, we have settled on only two certifications for launch:

## The experience as an existing employee at launch


## The experience as a newly onboarded employee post-launch
