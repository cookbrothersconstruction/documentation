# Issuing an Individual Employment Agreement in Employment Hero using an Advanced Document Template

## When can an IEA be issued?

An IEA (or any document template) can be issued at a few different points.

### At the end of the Recruitment module

At the final stages of the Recruitment module, a candidate will be moved into the **Hired** bucket:

Once in the **Hired** bucket, the **Onboard** option will appear:

Note that some Fields needed to be collected at this step:
- Location
- Start date
- Industry standard job title

Also note that this newly recruited employee does not need to be added to any teams, and no checklists will need to be triggered, as this will occur after the employee has accepted and signed their IEA.

The next step in this process is entering Pay Details:

Note that:
- Pay rate is required here, as is the Esct Rate % (which is calculated)
- Automatically enroll in KiwiSaver (or not, or ineligible)

At the end of this step there is a button to **Issue Contract**:
