# Issuing an Individual Employment Agreement in Employment Hero using an Advanced Document Template

## When do we issue a contract

An IEA (or any document template) can be issued at a few different points.

### At the end of the Recruitment module

At the final stages of the Recruitment module, a candidate will be moved into the **Hired** bucket:

![Moving a candidate into Hired](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/149c4df3-0879-4535-8bd0-32cc9c9536a1)

Once in the **Hired** bucket, the **Onboard** option will appear:

Note that some Fields needed to be collected at this step:
- Location
- Start date
- Industry standard job title

Also note that this newly recruited employee does not need to be added to any teams, and no checklists will need to be triggered, as this will occur after the employee has accepted and signed their IEA.

The next step in this process is entering Pay Details:

![Entering Pay Details](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/79bd35a7-171f-47a1-b3cc-5daadbdb338a)

Note that:
- Pay rate is required here, as is the Esct Rate % (which is calculated)
- Automatically enroll in KiwiSaver (or not, or ineligible)

At the end of this step there is a button to **Issue Contract**:

![Issue Contract button](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/330cef1f-089c-4f2c-90f8-991a633e0339)

This will take you to the Select Contract screen. This section is unique to sending document templates for contracts and provides additional functionality over the standard "Bulk Issue Documents" method, such as drafting the contract without auto-populated fields, finalizing / confirming the contract as the candidate will see it, and modifying the email which is sent to the candidate.

The first step is to select the contract which is **Cook Brothers Construction - Individual Employment Agreement**:

![Selecting the IEA](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/69570f08-bae8-4ee7-82da-65d487d7e44e)

This is where any missing information (in pink) can be filled in, and optional blocks or sections can be removed. Even though these pink fields have defaluts, this is a good opportunity to confirm these values:

![Setting variables](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/0d3b464e-fa60-4acf-b381-0da66e918a47)

Any of these variables that shouldn't exist can have their text removed:

![Removing text from variables](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/e0e47a05-dab7-40f6-8827-d3d33a4f5889)

Note that when doing this, don't hit enter after modifing the text as this will insert a new line. Instead simply click outside the field.

Finally, if you want someone else's name to appear as the sending signatory then modify this at the end of the document (the signature can be inserted on the next step):

![Modifying the sender](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/30195e9f-7d02-4394-84a6-e3803ad0798b)

After hitting **Continue** you will be taken to the **Finalise Contract** step.

On this step you can toggle the option to **Highlight variables** which will show you which variables you have modified:

At the end of this page you will **Finalise Document**

Another Sending signatory can be selected here, however you can also upload an image of a signature:

![Fish Signature](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/6a19ca0f-afa3-47fd-ac27-44c1e38321ad)

You can then modify the email content which will be sent to the new employee. Just make sure it includes the `!password_url`

From there you can save this as a draft, or email the document immediately.

`what does save as draft do?`

`do the changed fields get set against the employee after they're created?`

`confirm sending signatory appears correctly`

`how does hard-copy work / get confirmed`

## Next steps

- Check over employee info
- When contract is returned, add to teams and fire checklists
