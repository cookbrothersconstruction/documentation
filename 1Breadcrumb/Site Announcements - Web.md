# Site Announcements

Site Announcements are commonly used for communicating information to site attendees when they check-in to a site, or notify them if they are already checked in.

Different from Site Alerts which send an SMS (TXT) message to attendes, Site Announcements can be plain text, PDFs, images, videos or links. We can also make the viewing of announcements mandatory to ensure important information is seen.

Here's how a basic text announcement looks in the app when checking in to a site:

## Creating a Site Announcement

### Log in to the 1Breadcrumb Web Portal

Scroll down to and expand the Announcements section.
From there you will see a list of existing Site Announcements (if any), and the option to create a new one. **If there are old or expired announcements listed then you can remove them**

Hitting "Add New Announcement" will provide you the options to create a new Announcement:

After populating the Announcement fields, hit "Add New Announcement":

![Add New Announcement](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/2dc3a179-c71d-40bb-81d9-6f2f7cd99a04)


But then you must also hit Submit Changes at the top of this page:

![Submit Changes](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/3f69de81-850a-4586-aea0-08663c82ec1b)


## Announcement Options

First ensure that you have --- Create New Announcement ---- selected at the top.

There are several options available when creating a Site Announcement:


### Valid From / Valid To

These options can be used to limit the date range for which the announcement will be displayed.
It's generally recommended that you don't use these options, and instead leave them blank and delete any previous unused announcements. This helps keep the global announcment list clean.


### Display Time

This option indicates when this announcement should be shown, to include users who are already checked-in select
**Both**


### Mode

This option indicates whether users who are already checked-in should receive an app notification that there is a new announcement to view. Set this to:
**NotifyOnce**


### Force View Mode

This option forces the user to view the announcement before they can check in. If this is an important announcement, it's recommended to set this to:
**Mandatory View**

Alternatively if you want the user to have to sign-off on having viewed the announcement then select:
**Mandatory View and SignOff**


### Specific user options (Set to specific users, Set to specific industry type, Set to specific visitor type, Set to specific company supplier.

These options can be used to limit who or which type of visitors will see an anouncement.
You'll usually want everyone to see announcements so just leave these options off.


### Type

This is the type of announcement to show. Keep this simple and select from PDF, Text or Image

Usually a basic Text field will be enough, but Image will let you select an image from your phone, and PDF can be used for more detailed information (such as exporting the Procore Daily Pre-Start CAP inspection as in the advanced example below)


### Title

In order to help make Site Announcements maintainable you must title your announcement in this format:
**PROJECT_CODE DATE TITLE**
for example:

**D999 2023-09-19 Daily Hazards**


### Data / Link

Depending on the announcement type you've chosen, this is where you can enter the text for the announcement, or choose the image or PDF document.


### Display Mode

Set this to **AnyTime** so that the announcement is displayed to anyone no matter how they are checking in.


### Display As (images)

When your Announcement Type is an Image, you can use this field to display a preview before the announcement is opened.


### Announcement Group

This option should be left blank


# Examples

## Basic example - Text showing the hazards for the day.

Use these settings to create a text annoucement describing the hazards for the day which must be viewed when checking-in.

## Advanced example - Using the Procore Daily Pre-Start CAP Inspection as an announcement.

As you will be running daily pre-start caps in Procore through the Inspections tool, after completing the inspection you can load a PDF version as a Site Announcement by following these instructions.


After completing the inspection on the Procore web app, export the inspection as a PDF:

![Export inspection as PDF](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/bff82183-d461-4148-b1d1-ef246ab6d15d)


Save the PDF file to your computer:
![Save the PDF](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/36533bb4-135b-4e20-9062-0c47c930d70d)


Then use these settings (selecting PDF as Announcment Type, and choosing the PDF you downloaded):

![Create New Announcement](https://github.com/cookbrothersconstruction/documentation/assets/115191984/3c2a22ac-b316-4477-a97c-bddb54ef6eda)


Here's how the announcement will appear when someone checks in:

Based on these settings, the user will need to confirm that they have viewed the announcement:
