# Site Announcements

Site Announcements are commonly used for communicating information to site attendees when they check-in to a site, or notify them if they are already checked in.

Different from Site Alerts which send an SMS (TXT) message to attendes, Site Announcements can be plain text, PDFs, images, videos or links. We can also make the viewing of announcements mandatory to ensure important information is seen.

Here's how a basic text announcement looks in the app:

## Creating a Site Announcement

You can create a Site Announcement in the 1Breadcrumb mobile app from the host screen. **If you are a host of multiple sites, make sure you have the correct site selected**

From there you will see a list of existing Site Announcements (if any), and the option to create a new one. **If there are old or expired announcements listed then you can remove them**

Hitting "Add New Announcement" will bring you to the announcement creation screen:

## Announcement Options

There are several options available when creating a Site Announcement:

### Title

In order to help make Site Announcements maintainable you must title your announcement in this format:
**PROJECT_CODE DATE TITLE**
for example:

**D999 2023-09-19 Daily Hazards**


### Group Name

This option can be left blank


### Display Time

This option indicates when this announcement should be shown, to include users who are already checked-in select
**Both**


### Announcement mode

This option indicates whether users who are already checked-in should receive an app notification that there is a new announcement to view. Set this to:
**NotifyOnce**


### Force View Mode

This option forces the user to view the announcement before they can check in. If this is an important announcement, it's recommended to set this to:
**Mandatory View**

Alternatively if you want the user to have to sign-off on having viewed the announcement then select:
**Mandatory View and SignOff**


### Announcement Type

This is the type of announcement to show. Keep this simple and select from PDF, Text or Image

Usually a basic Text field will be enough, but Image will let you select an image from your phone, and PDF can be used for more detailed information (such as exporting the Procore Daily Pre-Start CAP inspection as in the advanced example below)


### Enter Text / Choose Media

Depending on the announcement type you've chosen, this is where you can enter the text for the announcement, or choose the image or PDF document.


### Display Mode

Set this to **AnyTime** so that the announcement is displayed to anyone no matter how they are checking in.


### Display As (images)

When your Announcement Type is an Image, you can use this field to display a preview before the announcement is opened.


### Active Date Range

This option can be used to limit the date range for which the announcement will be displayed.
It's generally recommended that you don't use the Time Limited option, and instead use the Valid Forever option deleting any previous announcements. This helps keep the global announcment list clean.

### Specific user options

These options can be used to limit who or which type of visitors will see an anouncement.
You'll usually want everyone to see announcements so just leave these options off.

### Active announcement

Leave this checkbox ticked so that the announcement appears and is applied to the site immediately.
