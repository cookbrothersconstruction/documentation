# Site Announcements

Site Announcements are commonly used for communicating information to site attendees when they check-in to a site, or notify them if they are already checked in.

Different from Site Alerts which send an SMS (TXT) message to attendes, Site Announcements can be plain text, PDFs, images, videos or links. We can also make the viewing of announcements mandatory to ensure important information is seen.
